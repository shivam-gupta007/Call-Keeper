Keep unwanted calls at bay with Call Keeper! 🚫

Call Keeper is an Android app that helps you manage unwanted incoming calls. With Call Keeper, you can:

- 👿 Reject calls from specific contacts.
- 📝 Customize rejection messages to be sent to the callers.
- 🗂️ Store a record of rejected calls and the corresponding message sent to the caller.

Call Keeper is easy to use and has an intuitive user interface. It is built with Kotlin and MVVM architecture and uses Room Database for efficient data storage and retrieval. Dependency Injection is used for decoupling and better testability.

## Here are some of the benefits of using Call Keeper:

- 🔇 You can reject calls from specific contacts, so you don't have to worry about being interrupted by unwanted calls.
- 💬 You can customize rejection messages to be sent to the callers, so they know why you're rejecting their calls.
- 🔎 You can store a record of rejected calls to track who has been calling you and when.

## Upcoming features 👀
- ⏳Location-based & schedule-based call rejection feature: allows users to activate or deactivate call rejection based on their schedule and location.
- ✅ Firebase integration: to store all the data on the cloud.
- 🔐First, users authenticate using biometrics or other options before enabling call rejection features.
